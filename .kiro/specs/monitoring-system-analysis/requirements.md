# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document analyzes the existing intelligent monitoring agent system that tracks and analyzes content changes across LinkedIn profiles, company pages, and websites. The system uses LangGraph for agent orchestration, detects meaningful updates using AI, and provides real-time notifications to users.

## Glossary

- **Monitoring_System**: The complete intelligent content monitoring application
- **LangGraph_Workflow**: The agent orchestration framework managing the monitoring process
- **Target**: A URL being monitored for content changes (LinkedIn profile, company page, or website)
- **Change_Detection**: AI-powered analysis that identifies meaningful content differences
- **Agent**: Individual components (Scheduler, Scraper, Analyzer, Notifier, Coordinator) that perform specific tasks
- **Celery_Worker**: Background task processor for scheduled monitoring operations
- **MongoDB_Database**: Document storage system for targets, changes, and user data
- **Gemini_AI**: Google's AI model used for intelligent change analysis

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content monitor, I want to add multiple monitoring targets with different frequencies, so that I can track various sources at appropriate intervals

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid URL with target type and frequency, THE Monitoring_System SHALL create a new monitoring target
2. THE Monitoring_System SHALL support LinkedIn profiles, LinkedIn company pages, and general websites as target types
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL allow frequency configuration from 1 minute to multiple hours
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL validate URL format before accepting targets
5. THE Monitoring_System SHALL prevent duplicate target URLs for the same user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content monitor, I want the system to automatically scrape content from my targets, so that I don't have to manually check each source

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a target is due for monitoring based on its frequency, THE Monitoring_System SHALL automatically fetch current content
2. THE Monitoring_System SHALL extract relevant content based on target type (profile info for LinkedIn, main content for websites)
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL handle network errors gracefully and retry failed requests
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL respect rate limiting to avoid being blocked by target sites
5. THE Monitoring_System SHALL store content snapshots for comparison purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content monitor, I want AI-powered change detection, so that I only get notified about meaningful updates rather than minor formatting changes

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN current content differs from previous content, THE Monitoring_System SHALL analyze changes using Gemini AI
2. THE Monitoring_System SHALL ignore minor formatting, whitespace, and timestamp changes
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL identify meaningful changes like job title updates, new posts, company announcements
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL generate concise summaries of detected changes
5. IF AI analysis fails, THEN THE Monitoring_System SHALL fall back to simple text comparison

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content monitor, I want to receive notifications when changes are detected, so that I can stay informed about important updates

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN meaningful changes are detected, THE Monitoring_System SHALL send console notifications immediately
2. WHERE email configuration is provided, THE Monitoring_System SHALL send email notifications
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL include change summary, timestamp, and source URL in notifications
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL store all detected changes in the database for historical reference
5. THE Monitoring_System SHALL continue monitoring even if notification delivery fails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content monitor, I want a web interface to manage my monitoring targets, so that I can easily add, remove, and view targets

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Monitoring_System SHALL provide a web interface accessible via HTTP
2. THE Monitoring_System SHALL allow users to add new targets through a form interface
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL display all active targets with their configuration and status
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL allow users to remove targets they no longer want to monitor
5. THE Monitoring_System SHALL show recent changes detected across all targets

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content monitor, I want the system to run continuously in the background, so that monitoring happens automatically without manual intervention

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Monitoring_System SHALL use Celery workers to process monitoring tasks in the background
2. THE Monitoring_System SHALL use Celery beat scheduler to automatically queue monitoring tasks based on target frequencies
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL coordinate multiple agents (Scheduler, Scraper, Analyzer, Notifier) using LangGraph workflows
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL handle system restarts by automatically resuming monitoring of all active targets
5. THE Monitoring_System SHALL provide health check endpoints to verify system status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content monitor, I want reliable data persistence, so that my targets and change history are preserved across system restarts

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Monitoring_System SHALL store all monitoring targets in MongoDB with their configuration
2. THE Monitoring_System SHALL store all detected changes with timestamps and summaries
3. THE Monitoring_System SHALL maintain content snapshots for comparison purposes
4. THE Monitoring_System SHALL update last-checked timestamps after each monitoring cycle
5. THE Monitoring_System SHALL handle database connection failures gracefully with automatic reconnection
